How to use the 'handleMenu' function
=====================================

STEP 1: Create a menu table containing the options and functions and destinations to sub-menus

--[[
Destination explanation: 
"_back" goes to the last menu you were in
"_function" shows that there is a function
"_exit" will exit the program
--]]

--# Example menu
someMenuTable = {
    ["English"] = {
        
        [1] = {
            name = "Exit the program",
            destination = "_exit",
        },
        
        [2] = {
            name = "Print function",
            destination = "_function",
                ["tFunction"] = {
                    name = test,
                        ["args] = {
                            "Hello World!",
                            2,
                            9,
                        },
                },
        },
    },  
}




STEP 2: Create a theme file/table

You can either create a table inside your program like this(Change the colors to what you want):




theme = {
   bColor         = colors.lightGray
   defaultTextCol = colors.white
   activeTextCol  = colors.yellow
   activeBackCol  = colors.gray
   headerBackCol  = colors.gray
   headerTextCol  = colors.white
}




or you can have a theme file that looks like this(Change the colors to what you want):



     bColor = gray,
     
     defaultTextCol = white, 
     
     activeTextCol = red, 
     
     activeBackCol = black, 
    
     headerBackCol = black, 
     
     headerTextCol = yellow,



and then load that file with this function: 
theme = loadTheme("<Theme_file>")


3: Run it and test that it works

handleMenu(someMenuTable,"English",1,theme)

4: ???
5: Profit! :D
